<h2>Decription</h2>
<p>You could put this pesto on a <storng>flip flop</storng> and it would still taste good! I serve it up at the peak of summer with fresh slices of heirloom tomatoes and burrata. It's hard to believe that this sauce comes together in under 5 minutes- making it perfect for those hot summer days where the kitchen is the last place we want to be! </p>
