Recipe webpage with 3 different pasta sauce recipes. Using only HTML, I 
was able to add different types of headings, bold text, italic text, 
images, ordered lists, and unordered lists. Not the prettiest of webpages, 
but that was not the point of this exercise, which was just to be able to 
get the information on the pages - and I did!
